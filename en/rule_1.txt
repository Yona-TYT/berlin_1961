they have still noticed in the fast changing world:<br>
<br>

<em>·</em> Trains from the cities <a href="(9,9)">Hamburg</a> and
<a href="(10,1010)">Frankfurt</a> may only be connected to West-Berlin.
When riding the train through the border station
<a href="(109,413)">Zone - Spandau (transit)</a> or
<a href="(106,882)">Zone - Wannsee (transit)</a>,
insert an additional stop and don't make any stop along
the track inside the DDR.<br>
<em>·</em> Connect the cities of <a href="(1013,9)">Warsaw</a> and
<a href="(1008,1010)">Prague</a> only with East-Berlin.<br>
<em>·</em> The airports of <a href="(510,1014)">Rome</a> and
<a href="(510,9)">Oslo</a> may have only one connection.<br>
<em>·</em> Cargo ships can cross the border.<br>
